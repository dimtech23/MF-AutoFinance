# Soft Delete Implementation for Client Management

## Overview
The client delete functionality has been upgraded from hard delete to soft delete to improve data safety and provide better business continuity.

## What Changed

### ðŸ”„ **From Hard Delete to Soft Delete**
- **Before**: Clients were permanently removed from the database
- **After**: Clients are marked as deleted but remain in the database

### âœ… **Benefits of Soft Delete**
1. **Data Safety**: No permanent data loss
2. **Audit Trail**: Track who deleted what and when
3. **Recovery**: Admins can restore deleted clients
4. **Business Continuity**: Prevents accidental data loss

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **Client Model Updates** (`../mf-auto-server/src/models/Client.ts`)
```typescript
// Added new fields to Client interface and schema
deleted?: boolean;           // Marks if client is deleted
deletedAt?: Date;           // When the client was deleted
deletedBy?: ObjectId;       // Who deleted the client
```

#### 2. **Controller Updates** (`../mf-auto-server/src/controllers/clientController.ts`)
- **`getAllClients`**: Now excludes deleted clients (`deleted: { $ne: true }`)
- **`getClientById`**: Now excludes deleted clients
- **`deleteClient`**: Now marks as deleted instead of removing
- **`restoreClient`**: New function to restore deleted clients

#### 3. **New API Endpoints**
- `DELETE /api/clients/:id` - Soft delete (marks as deleted)
- `PATCH /api/clients/:id/restore` - Restore deleted client (Admin only)

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **Updated Delete Confirmation Dialog**
- Changed title from "Confirm Delete" to "Confirm Move to Trash"
- Updated messaging to explain soft delete behavior
- Changed button from "Delete" to "Move to Trash"

#### 2. **Updated Tooltips**
- Desktop table: "Move to Trash" instead of "Delete"
- Mobile view: Added tooltip for delete button

#### 3. **Updated Success Messages**
- Shows "Client record moved to trash (soft deleted)" instead of "deleted successfully"

#### 4. **Fixed ID Handling**
- Properly handles both `id` and `_id` fields
- Prevents "undefined" ID errors

## How It Works

### For Users
1. **Delete Process**:
   - Click trash icon on any client
   - Confirm "Move to Trash" action
   - Client disappears from main list
   - Success message confirms soft delete

2. **What Happens**:
   - Client is marked as `deleted: true`
   - `deletedAt` timestamp is set
   - `deletedBy` records who performed the action
   - Client no longer appears in regular queries

### For Administrators
1. **Restore Process**:
   - Use API endpoint: `PATCH /api/clients/:id/restore`
   - Only admins can restore clients
   - Restored clients reappear in main list

## Database Impact

### Before Soft Delete
```javascript
// Client was permanently removed
await Client.findByIdAndDelete(clientId);
```

### After Soft Delete
```javascript
// Client is marked as deleted
await Client.findByIdAndUpdate(clientId, {
  $set: {
    deleted: true,
    deletedAt: new Date(),
    deletedBy: userId
  }
});
```

### Query Changes
```javascript
// Before: Get all clients
const clients = await Client.find();

// After: Get only non-deleted clients
const clients = await Client.find({ deleted: { $ne: true } });
```

## Security & Permissions

### Delete Permissions
- **Admin Only**: Can delete (soft delete) clients
- **Other Roles**: Cannot delete clients

### Restore Permissions
- **Admin Only**: Can restore deleted clients
- **Other Roles**: Cannot restore clients

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
1. **Trash View**: Admin interface to view deleted clients
2. **Bulk Operations**: Restore multiple clients at once
3. **Permanent Delete**: Option to permanently remove after soft delete
4. **Delete History**: Track all delete/restore actions

### Database Cleanup
- Consider periodic cleanup of very old deleted records
- Implement retention policies for deleted data

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. âœ… Delete a client (should disappear from list)
2. âœ… Try to access deleted client (should return 404)
3. âœ… Restore deleted client (should reappear in list)
4. âœ… Verify only admins can delete/restore
5. âœ… Check audit trail (deletedAt, deletedBy fields)

## Migration Notes

### Existing Data
- All existing clients remain unaffected
- No migration needed for current data
- New `deleted` field defaults to `false`

### API Compatibility
- Delete endpoint behavior changed (soft delete)
- New restore endpoint added
- Get endpoints now exclude deleted clients
- All other endpoints remain unchanged
