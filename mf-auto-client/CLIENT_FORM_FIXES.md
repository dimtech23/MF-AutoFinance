# Client Form Functionality Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### ðŸ”§ **New Client Form Issues**
1. **Form not closing after submission** - Fixed by removing `fetchClients()` call that was overriding local state
2. **New client not appearing at top of list** - Fixed by adding new clients to beginning of array instead of end
3. **Status updates not working properly** - Fixed by ensuring proper state updates for both clients and filteredClients

### ðŸ”§ **New Service Form Issues**
1. **Form not closing after submission** - Fixed by removing `fetchClients()` call
2. **Client status not updating with new service** - Added automatic status update when new service has different status
3. **Proper state management** - Fixed to update both clients and filteredClients arrays

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed `handleSubmitClient` Function**

#### Before:
```javascript
// Add new client to end of list
return [...prevClients, { ...clientResponse.data, id: responseId }];

// Call fetchClients() which overrides local state
await fetchClients();
```

#### After:
```javascript
// Add new client to beginning of list
const updatedClients = [newClientData, ...prevClients];
return updatedClients;

// Update filtered clients properly
setFilteredClients(prevFiltered => {
  if (isUpdate) {
    return prevFiltered.map(client => 
      (client.id === clientId || client._id === clientId) 
        ? newClientData
        : client
    );
  } else {
    return [newClientData, ...prevFiltered];
  }
});

// Scroll to top to show new client
window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
```

### 2. **Fixed `handleSubmitNewService` Function**

#### Before:
```javascript
// Only created appointment, didn't update client status
fetchClients(); // Override local state
```

#### After:
```javascript
// Update client status if different from new service
if (newServiceFormData.status !== selectedClientForNewService.repairStatus) {
  await clientsAPI.updateStatus(
    selectedClientForNewService.id || selectedClientForNewService._id, 
    newServiceFormData.status
  );
  
  // Update local state properly
  setClients(prevClients => 
    prevClients.map(client => 
      (client.id === selectedClientForNewService.id || client._id === selectedClientForNewService._id)
        ? updatedClient
        : client
    )
  );
  
  setFilteredClients(prevFiltered => 
    prevFiltered.map(client => 
      (client.id === selectedClientForNewService.id || client._id === selectedClientForNewService._id)
        ? updatedClient
        : client
    )
  );
}

// Scroll to top to show updated client
window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
```
