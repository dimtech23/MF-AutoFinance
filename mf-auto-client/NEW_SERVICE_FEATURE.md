# New Service Feature for Existing Clients

## Overview
This feature allows you to add new services to existing clients without creating a new client record. This is useful when a client returns for additional work or maintenance.

## How to Use

### Method 1: From Client Details Dialog
1. Click on any client in the table to open the client details
2. In the client details dialog, click the **"New Service"** button (blue button with plus icon)
3. Fill out the new service form with the required information
4. Click **"Create Service"** to save the new service

### Method 2: From Client Table Actions
1. In the clients table, find the client you want to add a service for
2. Click the **"+"** button in the actions column (next to edit and delete buttons)
3. Fill out the new service form
4. Click **"Create Service"** to save

### Method 3: From Mobile View
1. On mobile devices, the new service button appears in the client card actions
2. Tap the **"+"** button to open the new service form
3. Fill out the form and submit

## New Service Form Fields

### Required Fields:
- **Service Title**: A descriptive name for the service
- **Service Description**: Detailed description of the work to be performed
- **Service Date**: When the service will be performed

### Optional Fields:
- **Time**: Specific time for the service (defaults to 10:00 AM)
- **Service Type**: Choose between Repair, Maintenance, or Inspection
- **Status**: Scheduled, In Progress, or Completed
- **Estimated Cost**: Expected cost in Dalasi (D)
- **Estimated Duration**: Number of days the service will take
- **Repair Procedures**: Select from predefined repair procedures
- **Additional Notes**: Any extra information
- **Service Images**: Upload photos related to the service

## How It Works

1. **Creates an Appointment**: The new service is created as an appointment record linked to the existing client
2. **Updates Client Status**: If the service status is "In Progress", it may update the client's repair status
3. **Service History**: The new service appears in the client's service history
4. **Calendar Integration**: The service appears in the appointment calendar view

## Backend Integration

The feature uses the existing appointment API endpoints:
- `POST /api/appointments` - Creates the new service appointment
- The appointment is automatically linked to the existing client
- Service history is retrieved from appointments with type "repair"

## Benefits

1. **No Duplicate Clients**: Avoids creating multiple client records for the same person
2. **Complete History**: All services for a client are tracked in one place
3. **Better Organization**: Services are properly categorized and tracked
4. **Improved Workflow**: Streamlines the process of adding additional services

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes:
- Added new service form dialog in `src/views/pages/Clients.js`
- Added "New Service" buttons in client details and table actions
- Updated `src/components/ClientsTable.js` to include new service functionality
- Added form validation and error handling

### Backend Integration:
- Uses existing appointment API (`appointmentAPI.create()`)
- Leverages existing client-appointment relationship
- Maintains data consistency with existing system

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
1. **Service Templates**: Predefined service templates for common repairs
2. **Recurring Services**: Schedule recurring maintenance services
3. **Service Categories**: More detailed service categorization
4. **Cost Tracking**: Better integration with invoicing system
5. **Service Reminders**: Automatic reminders for scheduled services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Form won't submit**: Check that all required fields are filled
2. **Service not appearing**: Refresh the page to see the new service
3. **Client not found**: Ensure the client exists and is properly loaded

### Error Messages:
- "Service title is required" - Fill in the service title
- "Service description is required" - Add a description of the work
- "Service date is required" - Select a date for the service
- "Estimated cost must be a valid number" - Enter a valid cost amount
